Database optimization:

PRAGMA synchronous=OFF

  The Boolean synchronous value controls whether or not the library will wait for disk writes to be fully written to disk before continuing.
  This setting can be different from the default_synchronous value loaded from the database. In typical use the library may spend a lot of
  time just waiting on the file system. Setting "PRAGMA synchronous=OFF" can make a major speed difference.
